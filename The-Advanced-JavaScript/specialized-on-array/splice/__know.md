The splice() method is a built-in JavaScript array method that allows you to add, remove, or replace elements within an array. It can be used to modify the contents of an array in place. The splice() method takes multiple parameters:

Start Index: The index at which to start changing the array.
Delete Count: An integer indicating the number of old elements to remove (optional).
Items to Add: The elements to add to the array, starting from the start index (optional).
