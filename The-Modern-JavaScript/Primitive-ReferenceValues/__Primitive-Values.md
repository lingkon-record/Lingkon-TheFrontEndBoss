Primitive Values:
Primitive values are immutable data types. This means that their values cannot be changed once they are created. In ES6, there are six primitive data types:

Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
String: Represents text and is enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes.
Boolean: Represents a true or false value.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value primarily used as object property keys.
Primitive values are passed by value, meaning that when you assign a primitive to a new variable or pass it as an argument to a function, you're working with a copy of the actual value.
