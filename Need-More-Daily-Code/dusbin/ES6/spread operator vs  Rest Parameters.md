The spread operator (...) and rest parameters (...) are both features introduced in JavaScript to work with variable numbers of arguments or elements in arrays and objects, but they are used in slightly different contexts and have distinct purposes.

1. Spread Operator (...):

The spread operator is used to spread elements of an iterable (like an array or a string) into another array, object, or function call.

2. Rest Parameters (...):

Rest parameters allow you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array within a function declaration. They are used in function parameters to collect all remaining arguments into a single array variable.



*************
In summary:

The spread operator is used to spread elements from an iterable into another iterable or function call.

Rest parameters are used to collect a variable number of arguments into an array within a function.

While they use the same ... syntax, they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts within your code. The choice between using one or the other depends on your specific use case and whether you need to spread elements or collect them.
