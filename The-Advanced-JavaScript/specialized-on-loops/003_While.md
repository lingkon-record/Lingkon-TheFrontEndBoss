Here's how a while loop works:

The condition is evaluated before entering the loop.
 If the condition is initially false, the loop won't run at all.

If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed.

After executing the code inside the loop, the condition is evaluated again.

If the condition is still true, the loop continues to execute, and
 this process repeats until the condition becomes false.
