Benefits of Client Rendering

There are a couple of benefits to doing the rendering work on the client, including:

Interactivity: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.

Browser APIs: Client Components have access to browser APIs, like geolocation or localStorage, allowing you to build UI for specific use cases.
