useEffect is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. Side effects are operations that happen outside the normal flow of your component, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscriptions to external data sources. You use useEffect to manage these side effects in a React component. Here's why and when you should use useEffect:

Why use useEffect?

Data Fetching: You can use useEffect to fetch data from APIs or other external sources when your component mounts or when certain props or state values change. This is essential for building dynamic and data-driven applications.

DOM Manipulation: If you need to interact with the DOM, such as adding event listeners or updating the document title, useEffect can be used to perform these operations safely. This helps prevent memory leaks and keeps your component's behavior in sync with the DOM.

Subscriptions: If your component needs to subscribe to external data sources or events, like websockets or global state changes, you can use useEffect to establish and manage these subscriptions. Remember to clean up these subscriptions when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

Managing Timers: If your component needs to set up timers or intervals, useEffect can be used to start and stop them. Again, cleaning up timers in the useEffect cleanup function is important to avoid issues.

Synchronization: useEffect helps you ensure that your side effects run at the appropriate times in the component's lifecycle, such as after rendering or when specific dependencies change. This helps prevent race conditions and keeps your component's behavior predictable.

When to use useEffect?

You should use useEffect in the following scenarios:

Component Mounting: When you want to perform actions when the component initially renders, such as fetching initial data, setting up event listeners, or starting timers.

Component Updating: When you need to respond to changes in props or state by performing actions, like re-fetching data when a prop changes or updating the DOM based on state changes.

Component Unmounting: When you need to clean up resources, like unsubscribing from data sources, stopping timers, or removing event listeners when the component is unmounted.

Optimizing Performance: To optimize performance by controlling when expensive operations occur. You can use the dependency array to specify which variables or props the useEffect depends on, ensuring it only runs when necessary.





import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data when the component mounts
    fetchData()
      .then((result) => setData(result))
      .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once, when the component mounts

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render data */}
      {data.map((item) => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
