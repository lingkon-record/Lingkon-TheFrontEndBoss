Reference Values:
Reference values are more complex data types, and they are mutable, which means their values can be modified after they are created. In ES6, reference values include:

Objects: Used to represent collections of key-value pairs. These can include functions, arrays, and other objects.
Arrays: Specialized objects designed to store ordered collections of values.
Functions: Objects that can be invoked to perform a task.
Reference values are passed by reference. When you assign a reference value to a new variable or pass it as an argument to a function, you're working with a reference to the same underlying object.
